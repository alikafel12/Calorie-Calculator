# Calorie Calculator

A calorie calculator that computes the calories and macros you should be consuming according to your weight, height, activity level, etc. in order to lose weight and/or gain muscle. I calculated the numbers using the standard formulas used by the fitness industry for losing weight and gaining muscle.

* I decided to make this calculator because I wanted to lose some weight intially and I had no idea where to start. So I started to research some ways I could lose weight. One of the best ways was to diet. That would mean eating a certain amount of calories and macros so your body would only use what it needed and even use some of your fat in order to keep you going. It is the best way to lose weight and I lost over 25 pounds by doing it. But when I started this journey, I found a big problem there was no good way to calculate the calories and macros you should be consuming. Every calculator I used online gave me different numbers and macros, so I felt lost. I decided to make my own calculator using python and the tkinter library. I used the right formulas to make sure I computed the right numbers so I could lose weight in an optimal way. Other members in my family have used my calculator as well and have seen really good results as well.
